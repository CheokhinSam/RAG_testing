What self-attention do?,"['described in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate', 'during training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to', 'around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention ""Scaled Dot-Product Attention"" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n3', 'PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto 10000 ·2π. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\nPEpos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-', 'The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions.

The multi-head self-attention mechanism further enhances this by enabling the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously, counteracting the reduced effective resolution caused by averaging attention-weighted positions. This architecture allows the Transformer to model dependencies without regard to their distance in the sequence, enabling faster training and achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like translation after as little as twelve hours of training on eight P100 GPUs.",0.8542386450513175,,,
How does the Transformer model utilize the multi-head self-attention mechanism in its encoder to improve sequence representation compared to traditional recurrent models?,"['MultiHead(Q,K,V ) = Concat(head1,..., headh)WO\nwhere headi = Attention(QWQ\ni ,KW K\ni ,VW V\ni )\nWhere the projections are parameter matricesWQ\ni ∈Rdmodel×dk , WK\ni ∈Rdmodel×dk , WV\ni ∈Rdmodel×dv\nand WO ∈Rhdv×dmodel .\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n• In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[31, 2, 8].', 'aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks', 'described in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate', 'we found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = ∑dk\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\n4', 'Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building']","The Transformer model utilizes the multi-head self-attention mechanism in its encoder to improve sequence representation by enabling the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions in the input sequence. Unlike traditional recurrent models, which process sequences sequentially and rely on recurrence to model dependencies, the self-attention mechanism allows the Transformer to compute global dependencies between input elements in parallel. This significantly reduces sequential computation and increases parallelization, making the model more efficient.

Multi-head attention works by projecting the queries, keys, and values multiple times into smaller subspaces (using learned linear projections) and performing attention in parallel across these subspaces. The outputs from these attention heads are then concatenated and projected again to form the final representation. This approach avoids the averaging effect of single-head attention and captures richer, diverse features from the input sequence. Consequently, the Transformer achieves better sequence representations and faster training compared to recurrent models.","The Transformer model utilizes the multi-head self-attention mechanism in its encoder to improve sequence representation by allowing the model to draw global dependencies between input and output without relying on recurrence. The encoder is composed of a stack of six identical layers, each containing a multi-head self-attention mechanism as the first sub-layer. This mechanism enables the model to compute hidden representations in parallel for all input positions, reducing the number of operations required to relate signals from arbitrary positions to a constant number. This contrasts with traditional recurrent models, which process sequences sequentially, limiting parallelization and making it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions. By eschewing recurrence, the Transformer achieves significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance.",,1.0,,0.8
